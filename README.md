# Exchange Rate Notifier

## What
Simple Server which sends out notifications to Subscribed Users. Right now it supports only Exchange Rate Notifications.

## Why
Although there are million ways to get personal alerts like email, I found it useful to get push notifications on the subscribed events on my personal devices. I would prefer a notification system where I can customise the events to get notifications on custom time intervals rather than subsribing to various services and get my email platform bloated.

## How
So I decided to create a PWA, so that the client app have the flexibility, and a server which serves me alerts on the events I subscribe to.

## Where it started
This started out as a sample application for me to tryout 
- PWA's working
- Service Workers
- Push Notifications
- Scheduler Jobs
- Backend Architecture

## Later
This app is still in progress and Features will be added incrementally. Current plans are
- Add Custom Events.
- Add Custom Intervals for individual events.
- A dashboard for subscribed events.
